# WoW-Mail-Reminder-Addon
This is an Addon for the game World of Warcraft compatible with Patch Update 8.1 Battle for Azeroth.
It's a simple addon that plays a mail notification noise whenever a new mail enters the inbox.
This was coded primarily in Lua as I am not familiar with XML and I self-taught myself lua,
through the WoW Wikia page shown below and through the internet.
